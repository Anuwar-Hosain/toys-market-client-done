              A model car, or toy car, is a miniature representation of an
              automobile. Other miniature motor vehicles, such as trucks, buses,
              or even ATVs, etc. are often included in this general category.
              Because many miniature vehicles were originally aimed at children
              as playthings, there is no precise difference between a model car
              and a toy car, yet the word 'model' implies either assembly
              required or the accurate rendering of an actual vehicle at smaller
              scale. The kit building hobby became popular through the 1950s,
              while the collecting of miniatures by adults started to pick up
              momentum around 1970. Precision-detailed miniatures made
              specifically for adults are a significant part of the market since
              the mid-1980s
